<b>Conflict Plan</b>
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

Commmunication is key. When a issue arise each group member will voice their opinion and come to a resolution that best suits the project.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute? Due to the fact that our team consist of two member it is very important to us to divide work evenly as well as showcase each other skills.
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? It is important for us to work together and educate each other when someone does not understand a topic.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? IF resoultion attempts are unsucessful teammember will escalate the conflict to instructor.

Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

What hours will you be available to communicate?Normal class hour & as needed
What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?Slack
How often will you take breaks?
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?If things fall behind we will work additionally on weekends
How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?Slack
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard? Ask question and do check-ins with everyone to make sure we are all feeling valuable.
How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? No disrepect and negative speaking towards each other.

Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts. It is important for us that everyone does there part. We plan to divide work evenly.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?We plan to due task together and come to an agreement.
What project management tool will be used? Zoom, Slack and GitHub

Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team. Pratice run will be held on August 10th during normal class hours.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
