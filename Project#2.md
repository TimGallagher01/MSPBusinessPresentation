<b>Prepare for Projects: Systems Selection Document</b>
<p>This project will require you to demonstrate skills you’ve learned so far in the course.</p>

<b>Project Requirements</b>
<p>Your instructor will provide the project guidelines and send you the scenario unique to your team. Some aspects of the project are left up to you to decide how to approach.</p>

<b>Systems Selection</b>
<p>Review the project guidelines and scenario. Meet as a team and decide what systems, platforms, or tools you’ll be using this project. Each should represent a clear, logical solution to a problem the client company is facing.</p>

<b>We need two different types of computers systems</b>

<p>Standardize virtual desktops to Windows 10 pro with with microsoft outlook, onedrive installed. </p>

<p>Ubuntu Linux Desktop 20.10 with VS Code and Thunderbird</p>

<b>Other options to consider</b>
<b>Windows toolkits:</b> 
<p>Windows Autopilot, (reset, repurpose and refurbish devices)</p>
<p>Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, (automating windows and windows server operating system deployment, set up bench have it grab collection of files)</p>
<p>PXE Boot (Booting to a server and installing a image)</p>

<b>Linux provisioning tools:</b> 
<p>Spacewalk (Systems management software developed by Red Hat)</p>
<p>xCAT  (Extreme Cluster Administration tool)</p>
<p>FAI (High quality tool for automatic installation of Linux systems)</p>
<p>Cobbler (OS provisioning and profile management)</p>
<p>M23 (Sotfware distribution and management system)</p>
<p>OpenQRM (Systems management platform)</p>
<p>Foreman (Life cycle systems management tool)</p>





<b>Create a high-level list of systems, platforms, or tools you’ve decided to work with this project. For each, explain:</b>
<p> We will be working with Standardize virtual desktops to Windows 10 pro with with microsoft outlook, onedrive, and Windows Autopilot. Ubuntu Linux Desktop 20.10 with VS Code, Thunderbird and FAI. </p>
 
<b>OS Privisioning</b>
<p>Windows</p>
<p>How does it fit into your scenario’s requirements?</p>
<p>We will import an OVA file for the virtual desktop. OracleVM to deploy windows 10 VM</p>
<p>What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?</p>
<p>Sales would have a lot easier time using the windows 10 software.<p>
<p>Keep it high level without going into too much detail, 3-4 sentences is enough.</p>
<p><p>
<p>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.</p>
<p><p>
<p>What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?</p>
<p>MVP would be virtualbox and importing an OVA file<p>

<p>Linux</p>
<p>How does it fit into your scenario’s requirements?</p>
<p>FAI to install linux on computer for software engineers f</p>
<p>What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?</p>
<p>Linux tends to be preferred by software enginners and the FAI tool can help install it<p>
<p>Keep it high level without going into too much detail, 3-4 sentences is enough.</p>
<p><p>
<p>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.</p>
<p><p>
<p>What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?</p>
<p>For this example we will use virtualbox to deploy the preconfigured linux box. Slide show<p>
 
<b>Data</b>
<p>Windows</p>
<p>How does it fit into your scenario’s requirements?</p>
<p>Every desktop should come standard with a backup harddrive with a system to backup the drive every night and every week.
</p>
<p>What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?</p>
<p>In case any person loses their data it can be restored by hardware failure, disasters, attacks, etc it will all be backed up<p>
<p>Keep it high level without going into too much detail, 3-4 sentences is enough.</p>
<p><p>
<p>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.</p>
<p><p>
<p>What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?</p>
<p>Scheduling a batch script in task scheduler to back up information at midnight. Veeam for backup?<p>

<p>What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?</p>
<p>Bash file in Cron daemon. Also could use Veeam for backup?<p>
 
 <b>Connectivity</b>
<p>Windows</p>
<p>How does it fit into your scenario’s requirements?</p>
<p>Sales rep will remote into the computer from home. They're not GUI computers</p>
<p>What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?</p>
<p>Sales rep can use their own computer so it would be less cost for the business<p>
<p>Keep it high level without going into too much detail, 3-4 sentences is enough.</p>
<p><p>
<p>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.</p>
<p><p>
<p>What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?</p>
<p>Remote in to desktop. <p>

<p>Linux</p>
<p>How does it fit into your scenario’s requirements?</p>
<p>Nothing listed under connectivity for linux machines. We are taking the liberty of saying the software engineers are going into the office to using desktops directly connect to the mainframe</p>
<p>What problem or pain point does it solve? In other words, what value does this add to your client?</p>
<p>More secure. Software engineers can learn from eachother<p>
